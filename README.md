Like every other Indian Cricket fan, even I had the curiosity to know who is the best batsmen when compared Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar to Virat Kohli. Sachin was GOAT at his era and Virat is GOAT in his era, here the challenge to analyze and to arrive at the conclusion is their respective time frames. Therefore I've taken early 2000s for Sachin Tendulkar
statistics and late 2000s for Virat Kohli's statistics. Next to test cricket which is considered as the gentlemen's game
I love One day international matches to watch. That is the reason why I've taken ODI data set to analyze. I've considered few problem statements to analyze and based upon this we came to know who is stronger in which problem statement. 
The probleme statements are:
# Runs per innings
# SR
# 100's
# 50's
# Team contribution
